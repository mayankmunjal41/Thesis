This inquiry is particularly fascinating when considering India. The deep-rooted tradition of vegetarianism, coupled with the abundance of naturally vegan ingredients and dishes, positions India as a potential springboard for exploring a more plant-based future.</p><p class="pt-sans-regular"><strong>Let's explore 100 popular Indian recipes to see how many are vegan and how easily others can be adapted.</strong></p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/17796979"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div></main></div><div class="findings"><main><p class="viz-title">Vegan-Friendly Recipes Breakdown</p><img src="./breakdown.svg" alt=""></main></div><div class="substitutes"><main><div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/17798284"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><div class="sub-desc"><p class="viz-title" style="text-align: left">Vegan Alternatives to Meat, Dairy, and Egg Products</p><p class="pt-sans-regular">As we saw, Indian cuisine has a high share of naturally vegan ingredients and recipes.

By embracing these naturally vegan dishes and readily available substitutes, India can become a model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and paving the way for a more sustainable future for our planet.</p><img src="./vegans.png" alt=""></main><p class="about-data .pt-serif-regular">About the Data</p><main class="data"><p class="pt-sans-regular"><strong>1. Global Cuisine Dataset:</strong> The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset/data" target="_blank">dataset</a>, featured in a Kaggle playground competition titled "What's Cooking?", includes a training set (train.json) and a test set (test.json). The training set contains recipe IDs, types of cuisine, and lists of ingredients, while the test set includes recipe IDs and lists of ingredients.</p><p class="pt-sans-regular"><strong>2. Indian Cuisine Dataset:</strong> The data sources for this dataset include Wikipedia, Hebbar's Kitchen, and Archana's Kitchen. The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/indian-food-101" target="_blank">dataset</a> includes columns for the name of the dish, ingredients, type of diet (vegetarian or non-vegetarian), course (e.g., starter, main course, dessert), state of origin, and region.</p></main></div><div class="research"><p class="viz-title">Data Analysis</p><main class="analysis"><div><p class="pt-sans-regular">To test the hypothesis that Indian cuisine can serve as a blueprint for global veganism, the dataset of over 40,000 recipes was explored, and a sample of at least 800 recipes for several popular cuisines was taken. This sampling approach ensured that each cuisine was well represented while managing computational resources effectively.</p><p class="pt-sans-regular">Next, each recipe was classified as either vegan or non-vegan by identifying and filtering out non-vegan ingredients such as milk, meat, and butter.</p></div><img src="./analysis.png" alt=""></main><p class="pt-sans-regular"><strong>The Road Forward: A Sustainable and Ethical Food System</strong><br>While challenges exist, the potential for a vegan blueprint in India is undeniable. By promoting innovation in plant-based alternatives, fostering consumer education, and addressing the unique role of dairy, India can carve its own path in the global vegan landscape. Success will depend on creating a future where vegan options are not just replacements, but rather stand-alone culinary creations that are delicious, affordable, and culturally relevant. This, in turn, can contribute to a more sustainable and ethical food system, not just in India, but globally.</p><p class="pt-sans-regular"><strong>Further Research:</strong><br>This research lays the groundwork for a more comprehensive exploration of a vegan blueprint in India. Future studies could delve deeper into consumer attitudes towards veganism, the economic feasibility of plant-based alternatives, and the role of social marketing in promoting vegan options within the Indian context. Additionally, exploring the potential of indigenous and underutilized plant-based ingredients can further strengthen the foundation for a future-oriented vegan food culture in India.</p></div><script src="/thesis/js/chunk-vendors.6bfd235f.js"></script><script src="/thesis/js/app.d4d9015e.js"></script></body></html>
